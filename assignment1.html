<h2 style="color: skyblue;">1. Introduction to Laser Cutting</h2>

<p>Laser cutting is a precise manufacturing process that uses a high-powered laser beam to cut, engrave, or mark materials like wood, acrylic, and metal. It is widely used in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and electronics due to its accuracy, speed, and clean finish.</p>
<p>For this assignment, laser cutting was used to fabricate a hollow truncated icosahedron sphere from 2mm MDF sheets, ensuring clean edges and precise assembly.</p>

<h2 style="color: skyblue;">2. Objective:</h2>
<p>The objective of this project was to design a hollow truncated icosahedron sphere with a 50mm outer diameter using MDF (2mm thickness) for laser cutting and assembly.</p>

<strong>Design Specifications:</strong>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Outer Sphere Diameter:</strong> 50mm</li>
    <li><strong>Material Thickness:</strong> 2mm MDF</li>
    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> 12 Pentagons + 20 Hexagons</li>
    <li><strong>Edge Length:</strong> 19.5mm</li>
    <li><strong>Dihedral Angle:</strong> 41.81° (Pentagon-Hexagon)</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2 style="color: skyblue;">3. Truncated Icosahedron</h2>
<p>A truncated icosahedron is a geometric shape composed of 12 pentagonal and 20 hexagonal faces. It resembles a football and is commonly used as the structure for soccer balls.</p>

<br>
<h2 style="color: skyblue;">4. Design and Assembly Procedure</h2>

<h3><b>Step 1:</b> Creating Sketches</h3>
<p>In Fusion 360, we created a base sketch of a pentagon and a hexagon, ensuring the edge length was precisely set to 19.5mm.</p>

<h3><b>Step 2:</b> Assembling the Faces</h3>
<p>Using the Move & Rotate Tool, we arranged the pentagons and hexagons into a spherical structure. The dihedral angle was set to 41.81° between the pentagons and hexagons.</p>

<h3><b>Step 3:</b> Preparing for Laser Cutting</h3>
<p>The design was flattened using the Unfold Tool in Fusion 360 and exported as a DXF file for laser cutting.</p>

<h3><b>Step 4:</b> Laser Cutting</h3>
<p>The MDF sheets were laser cut precisely to produce clean-edged hexagons and pentagons. This ensured easy assembly.</p>

<h3><b>Step 5:</b> Final Assembly</h3>
<p>The cut pieces were carefully assembled to form a hollow truncated icosahedron sphere using adhesive.</p>

<h2 style="color: skyblue;">5. Challenges Faced</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Alignment Issues:</strong> Ensuring proper alignment of all faces was challenging but overcome by referencing the base structure.</li>
    <li><strong>Edge Burning:</strong> Minor burns on the edges were minimized by adjusting the laser power settings.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2 style="color: skyblue;">6. Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>This project provided valuable hands-on experience in:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Geometric modeling and polyhedron design.</li>
    <li>DXF file generation and precision laser cutting.</li>
    <li>Proper assembly techniques using precise angles and edge lengths.</li>
